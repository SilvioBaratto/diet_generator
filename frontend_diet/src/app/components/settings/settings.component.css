/* Settings component styles - Replaced with Tailwind utilities in template */
/* All styles have been moved to Tailwind classes for better consistency and performance */

/*
  Previous custom styles replaced with Tailwind utilities:
  
  .form-input -> transition-all duration-200 + focus states with Tailwind
  .form-input:focus -> hover:scale-[1.02] active:scale-[0.98] + shadow utilities
  .form-section -> animate-in fade-in duration-500 + delay variants
  fadeInUp animation -> slide-in-from-bottom-2 and fade-in utilities
  
  Benefits of using Tailwind utilities:
  - Better purging and smaller bundle size
  - Consistent design system
  - Better responsive design control
  - Easier maintenance and debugging
